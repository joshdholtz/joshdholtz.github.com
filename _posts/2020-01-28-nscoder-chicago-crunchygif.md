This was "Show & Tell" style talk about Josh's first macOS app, [CrunchyGIF](https://www.crunchygif.app), which is the easiest way to convert screen recording to GIFs. The talk goes through how Josh used a "SHIP ASAP" approach where he solves the technical thing he didn't know how to do and then "ships" to production to solve any release issues. After that its all fun and games with features and UI/UX.

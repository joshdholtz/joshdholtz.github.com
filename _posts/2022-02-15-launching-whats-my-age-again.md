description: iOS app for remembering your age (and others) with widgets

Oops, I did it again… I accidently created and launched another app.

**Happy launch day, What's My Age Again!** 🥳

## _What is What's My Age Again?_

**What's My Age Again** is my solution to me not being able to remember my age. I'm always asking my wife and she doesn't need that kind of pressure on her. I threw together a quick widget only app in an hour or two 👇

And as I do often, I shared my weird experiment on Twitter 👇 It seemed like it resonated with a handful of people so I decided to polish it and ship it!

Great for kids when they go from days to weeks to months to years<br><br>Maybe launch soon? 🤷‍♂️ <a href="https://t.co/WVFsm4Ymfn">pic.twitter.com/WVFsm4Ymfn</a></p>&mdash; Josh “so many typos” Holtz 💪🚀 (@joshdholtz) <a href="https://twitter.com/joshdholtz/status/1490060893383798789?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## _Why only widgets?_

I already debatably stretch myself to thin with [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools), [Indie Dev Monday](https://indiedevmonday.com), other indie apps, and my full-time job at [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com) where I really didn't want to make and maintain another app 😛 Widgets are a simple enough concept to make and maintain and that is all I really wanted to do. They have very little interaction and a simple user interface that doesn't overwhelm me if and when I want to make changes.

## _Here are we_

This app (if you can call it that) isn't meant to be some ground breaking huge thing. I wanted this for me but I wanted others to use it (if they wanted to).

Thanks for reading this very short story about **What's My Age Again** and I hope that some of you enjoy using this app!

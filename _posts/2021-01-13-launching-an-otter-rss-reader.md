**Today is the day!** It's been a long time coming. I originally started working on and released the initial beta version of <strong>An Otter RSS</strong> in August of 2020. After five months, I'm finally releasing it to the public!

**Happy launch day, An Otter RSS** ü•≥

## _Why did you make An Otter RSS?_

I was developing another in July of 2020. This app was my first app built completely in SwiftUI. I was ending reading a lot of Swift and SwiftUI blogs since I didn't really know what I was doing at the time. I realized I wanted to keep up with all the blogs I was finding. I've never been a big RSS reader but this seemed like the time to get into it. I wasn't going to be a power user so I wasn't looking to pay for anything that required a subscription. But I _did_ want my feeds to sync between my iPhone, iPad, and Mac. It turns out (at that time) I couldn't find one that I liked.

**So I decided to make my own üòú**

I made a quick and dirty prototype that shared a list of feeds and articles in about five hours. 

I shared my progress on Twitter and I had a lot of people seem interested in it. I decided to keep going on this RSS reader and shared it on¬†[https://airport.community](https://airport.community) and got a lot more passionate testers than I expected ü•≥

I let this app sit for a while because¬†I was happy with it. It is what I wanted and nothing more. I was also building [ConnectKit](https://connectkit.app) at the time. I got consumed by the Shortcuts and the App Store Connect API. I was still using <strong>An Otter RSS</strong> every day though! I just didn't know what I wanted to do with it yet.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago and my beta app expired üò´ My users wanted it back and I wanted it back for them. I didn't want to keep making new betas to fight the expiriation so the App Store seemed like the right path to go.

I had a weird amount of "free time" since I'm currently on family leave (me and my wife just had our first child). I decided I would take the time in between feedings, cryings, and sleeps (which isn't much) to prep it for the App Store.

So I did and here we are. It's launch day!

## _Why is it free?_

I made this app for me! I made it as a learning experience and for something I would personally use. I don't want the pressure of having a paid app to make it what users want ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è But I do care what users thinkg and what so I will take feature requests and bug reports seriously üòâ

There **is** an in-app payment for **tipping the developer** _if_ users want to do so. The in-app payment gets the user my eternal love, alternative app icons, and some new app color themes (coming in a future version). It's not much and not functionality that is needed for the app. But I did want the app to be free with all the RSS features!

## _What does An Otter RSS do?_

<strong>An Otter RSS</strong> doesn't do much but it does everything I want it to. My goals were:

- Subscribe to RSS feeds (sync over iCloud)
- List new articles for each feed (sync over iCloud)
- Show read/unread status of articles (sync over iCloud)
- Support for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS
- Background refreshing with local notifications

Things I didn't want:

- Fancy reading styles (viewing in webview was perfectly fine)

**That was it üòÅ** I wanted just an okay looking RSS reader with minimal functionality. And that is exactly what <strong>An Otter RSS</strong> is still today! There are plenty of more powerful RSS apps out there if people want something more. That's totally fine with me! I get it üôÉ

I also ended up adding a bit more along the way!

- Import/export with OPML
  - Bring your existing feeds in
  - Take them with you if you don't like it
- Widgets
- Shortcuts

## An Otter RSS's Future and Beyond

I'm not exactly sure what is in store for <strong>An Otter RSS</strong>'s future yet! I know I plan to keep up with maintenance and support üòá I want to add a few more widget types (since widgets are really fun to make). At some point I would also like to improve the UI. It's okay and it works for what I want but I think it would be a fun personal challenge to really polish the app up.

A few weeks ago I was asked to give a presentation on “Entrepreneurship and iOS Development” for a college class on [Swift](https://swift.org/) at the [Milwaukee School of Engineering](http://www.msoe.edu/). I didn’t want to turn down this opportunity to mold some minds so I said “yes” without really thinking too much.

As I thought about it some more, I realized I was starting to regret my decision. My insecurities about my **stutter** started to show and I instantly wanted to back down. Speaking isn’t my thing. Public speaking really isn’t my thing. A lot of my worst experiences as a stutterer have come from public speaking. The last thing I wanted to do was embarrass myself in a front of a group of college students by not being able to talk about the thing I am supposedly an “expert” in.

*What was I to do?!*

## Playing To My Strengths

*Duh*. It’s pretty obvious that “playing to your strengths” is usually in one’s own best interest. I was, however, starting off a pretty big disadvantage being that I have a stutter and I signed myself up to do a public speaking gig.

My stutter usually comes out the worst in a few types scenarios. The worst type of scenario being ones where I have something **rehearsed** I have to say — and a presentations falls exactly in the category. As a stutterer, I have words that I “know” that I usually fail on. Those words are automatically thrown out of my vocabulary. After rehearsing what I’m about to say, I start to think about other words that I could fail which means I also have to throw those words out of my vocabulary. At the end I’m pretty much left with a vocabulary of zero words with a vision of me just standing up in the front of a crowd with nothing to say.

*This is of course almost never the case for me but this is what constantly plays through my head. The amount of anxiety this causes is unreal.*

## So What Are My Strengths?

I like to think that one of my strengths is the ability to find “fun” in any situation. While needing to make the presentation fun, I also needed a way to get out of the mindset of the “rehearsed” presentation. So how could I combine these two? After a little bit of thinking I had an idea…

### The “Choose your own adventure” Presentation

I am giving this presentation to a bunch of college students: I want them to be engaged, I don’t want them falling asleep on me, and I needed to not have a “rehearsed” presentation. I decided on making the presentation a “Choose your own adventure” presentation — similar to the books that I read when I was a kid

I started off the presentation with the two normal introduction slides and then **BAM**, hit them with the choices that my presentation all offered. Each path was linked to a point in my presentation for that section. After each section, there was slide that said “Your adventure has ended — click here to start over”.

As soon as these slides appear, the students sat up straighter in their chairs and my presentation had their undivided attention. I heard a few conversations of people trying to decided what they wanted to hear first. I also like to think I may have gained their respect because they realized I made this presentation for them.

**Bonus**: By breaking the presentation down into six sections, the students actually asked me questions at the end of each section. It turned the presentation into more of a discussion than a lecture which the students seemed to enjoy &#9786;

*My plan definitely worked for me. This instantly calmed my nervous because the students were liking my presentation. This entail upped my confidence of my “speaking without stuttering” abilities. I also had to no idea what the students were going to choose and therefore couldn’t plan my stuttering failures.*

### The “Humorous” Presentation

As I wrote above, one of my other strengths is to try and turn any situation into a “fun” one. The more fun there is, the more relaxed I am. The more relaxed I am, the less I tend to stutter. So no better way than to load your presentation with dank memes, cat, and Drake pictures/quotes.

Luckily the students all got my jokes &#9786; Them laughing at some of my slides also gave me some time to relax and breathe and to make sure I was ready to keep speaking like a pro.

## It Wasn’t So Scary In The End

I regret ever regretting taking the speaking gig. It actually ended up being a fun experience and I got some really good feedback from the students. I found a way to make the presentation fun for me **and** my listeners all while developing the presentation in a way the best fit **me and my stutter**.

So what should *you* take away from this? Hopefully some sort of inspiration that its possible to use your strengths to turn a hard speaking situation around (or any kind of situation for that matter). All it takes is a little bit of creativity and some fun.

If it wasn’t for my stutter, I probably would have gone at this presentation without anything special— just slide after slide after slide. Some students probably wouldn’t have been engaged. Some students would have probably fallen asleep. I probably wouldn’t have made an impact.

Thankfully, I have a stutter! &#9786;
